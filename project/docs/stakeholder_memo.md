# Stakeholder Memo: Soybean Meal MACD Trading Strategy

## Overview
This project develops and backtests a trading strategy for soybean meal futures using the MACD indicator, specifically focusing on peak and trough signals. The goal is to evaluate whether systematic technical analysis can improve trading performance compared to passive or discretionary approaches.

## Why It Matters
Soybean meal is a key agricultural commodity tied to livestock and food industries. Its price volatility—driven by supply-demand shifts, weather conditions, and global trade—creates opportunities and risks for traders and hedgers. A rules-based strategy can provide:
- More consistent decision-making
- Improved entry and exit timing
- Potentially higher returns with risk management

## Key Results
- Backtested performance shows how MACD signals align with market trends.
- Metrics such as returns, volatility, and drawdowns demonstrate the strategy’s strengths and limitations.
- Findings provide a foundation for future refinements, such as parameter tuning or integration with other indicators.

## Stakeholders
- **Commodity traders & portfolio managers**: seek profitable and systematic strategies.
- **Risk management teams**: value evidence-based approaches to mitigate volatility.
- **Agribusiness analysts**: gain insights into price behavior for hedging and forecasting.
